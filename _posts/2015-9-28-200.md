So I hit 200 days of commit to <a href="https://github.com/TaylorHuston" target="_blank">my GitHub</a>. Pretty proud of myself for that. Other than that I've just been trucking along through the three Coursera specializations I'm currently enrolled in. I'll have reviews of the actual courses up pretty soon. In general they aren't teaching me anything new, yet, not really worth the money, but I am hoping the more advanced courses later on in the specializations makes up for that. I also finished re-reading the chapter on Graphs from <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/" target="_blank">Algorithms, 4th ed.</a> and coding up my own implementations of those for practice. Still need to do the same for the chapter on Strings at some point, but I think I am going to back-burner that for a bit while I get caught up on some other things. Specifically I picked up the new 6th edition of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Edition/dp/0984782850" target="_blank">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> and I want to read through that, start prepping for interviewing soon.
