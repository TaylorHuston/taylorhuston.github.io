<p>Here are my clich√© New Years resolutions for this year</p>
<ul>
<li>Write at least 2 posts here each week.</li>
<li>Write some code every day.</li>
<li>Stick to my vegan diet.</li>
<li>Ride my bike every day, try to increase total miles ridden in a week every week.</li>
<li>Get back down to 145lb, where I was last summer before a semester of stress eating (and then my mom's holiday baked goods) took their toll.</li>
<li>Re-learn Japanese, then French</li>
<li>Volunteer a MINIMUM of once a month, more if I can.</li>
</ul>
<p>Totally do-able, right?</p>
