<p>I need to update this more.  I'm a busy man!  Stop bothering me.</p>
<p>Still on track to start at PSU.  Not officially enrolled in any classes at the moment, self studying, have to take some finals as 'placement' tests over the next few weeks.  They are making me jump through a lot of hoops, but it will be worth it in the long run.</p>
<p>Still debating on buying a condo/townhome or not.  I was pre-approved for more then enough, and I make enough to afford it, but do I want that kind of commitment?  I don't even like signing a cell phone contract.  Plus, for the amount of money I was pre-approved for I can either get a 1 bedroom place downtown close to campus, which would be nice, but I would probably sell it in two years after I graduate with my Masters, so taking that into consideration, would it even be worth it when I can still get a 1 bedroom apartment close to campus for several hundred a month cheaper?  On the other hand, for the same amount of money I can get a 3 bedroom with a garage and a backyard, but then I would have to live in the suburbs, and juggling work and school will be significantly easier when I have a 5 minute bike ride to class as opposed to a 30 minute drive, plus dealing with parking and all that jazz.  Decisions decisions.</p>
<p>I promise I will get my photos sorted, edited and uploaded this weekend, and by promise I mean I might do it if there's nothing good on tv.</p>
<p>Enjoy your weekend everyone!</p>
