I know it's been a while since I've posted. Honestly, nothing particularly noteworthy has happened. But I thought it'd be good to touch base.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>30 Days:</strong></span> I've reached a personal milestone. 30 straight days of contributions to <a href="https://github.com/TaylorHuston" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. While I've been coding almost every day for a while now, due to a lot of it being homework assignments and other things I can't make publicly available, this is the first time I've been able to actually push something to GitHub for a month straight. And it's really kept me motivated. Since I don't want to break the streak I am less likely to say "man I coded all day yesterday, I'm just going to take the day off".

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rails:</strong></span> Welp I've seen the light. While I still think that JS syntax is more intuitive to me, I can see why people love Rails. It is insanely easy to get a minimum viable product up and running quickly. And I can really see how the whole convention over configuration thing is great. You can look at any Rails app written by anyone and start with a pretty good idea of where everything is. I'm about halfway done with the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/webapplications" target="_blank">Coursera Rails</a> course, and almost done with <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Michael Hartl's Book.</a> After that I plan on reading through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-Edition-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321944275" target="_blank">The Rails 4 Way.</a> I think at that point I will be to the point where I can start looking into entry-level Rails jobs, or maybe a Bootcamp? Right now I am just creating the sample app outlined in Hartl's book directly, but after I am done with that my next project will be re-doing <a href="http://willcodeforfood.io/" target="_blank">Will Code For Food</a> in Rails. Should be an excellent learning opportunity.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Android:</strong></span> I'm also still in the middle of the second <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/posaconcurrency" target="_blank">Coursera Android</a> course. I will admit though that I've been so focused on Rails that I haven't been giving that class the attention it deserves. I am going to need to spend this week focusing on getting caught up on it. I also got a copy of <a href="https://commonsware.com/Android/" target="_blank">The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development</a>. Haven't had a chance to really look at it, but it sounds like a great resource. For one thing, it's huge. At over 3000 pages it dwarfs any other programming book I've come across. I also like that it's regularly updated. For something as ever-evolving as Android that's really important to me. I looked at some other Android books (I still stand by the assertion that the best way to learn something is to read a good book), and they were all already out of date. Couldn't find one that was highly rated and covered Android 5.0+. While I don't think a book that only went up to say, Android 4.4 wouldn't be full of useful information, I don't want to feel like I am being left behind in any way. Technology moves so fast that I think regularly updated online textbooks are the future.

On a work related note, I am now officially the 'Lead Template Developer' at my work. Which is basically what I've been doing since January anyway, just now it says so on paper. No raise, of course, but I now am doing that full-time, instead of in between support phone calls and emails. The first responsibility of this job was to make new, mobile-responsive versions of all of our existing templates, and coordinate the testing and release of them. After that I will probably be receiving PSDs/mockups of new templates from our parent company's graphic design team, and will be tasked with making new templates based on those. So that should be fun. Nothing too complicated, still just HTML and CSS, with the occasional JS thrown in. Not the kind of work I want to do forever, but it certainly beats taking support phone calls.
