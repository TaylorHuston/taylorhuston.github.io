<h3>Hackers</h3>
<p>Hackers is my favorite movie. It isn't a good movie by any typical measure of what makes a movie great. It's acting doesn't particularly stand out. The story is entertaining but by no means revolutionary. It does have a fantastic soundtrack, but by most typical definitions it is an above average film at best. Yet I can watch it over and over and over again and never not be entertained</p>
<h3>What defines a good movie?</h3>
<p>What does one define as a good movie anyway? Normally when you ask this question you get some response relating to good acting or directing or cinematography. Which are all good things, but is that really what makes a movie good?</p>
<h3>Movies are a source of entertainment</h3>
<p>At their core, films are supposed to entertain people. So wouldn't this mean that the movie that entertains the most amount of people the most amount of times is the best? I bring this up because I have realized that there are many films that are considered great movies. Classics even. But they are also the kind of movie that most people only watch once, maybe twice in their entire lifetime. The Citizen Kane's and Schindler's Lists of the film world. Ask anyone and 90% of people will tell you that these movies are classics, films that should be revered for all time. Yet ask those same people whether they would like to watch one of those movies or some action movie filled with cool special effects and lots of 'splosions, most people are going to choose the action movie. They 'know' Citizen Kane is a better film, but they will still choose the movie with 19 unnecessary car chases in it. So by this definition, is the action film a 'better' movie then the revered classic? I 'know' that 12 Angry Men is better then the new Tron, but guess which one I queue up on Netflix when I feel like being entertained for an hour or so? A lot of 'classic' movies just aren't that fun to watch more then once. Once you know how they end, the appeal is gone.</p>
<h3>Movies are supposed to make money</h3>
<p>The film business is just that, a business. Businesses, at their core, are out to make money. There are many movies the receive massive critical acclaim that like 19 normal people actually go see in the theaters. Then you have Transformers 3, which was absolute dog shit, and it makes a bazillion dollars in the theaters. It will make that much again from DVD sales, Netflix rentals, etc. Meanwhile the artsy, critically acclaimed film that is considered a 'better' film will be largely forgotten after a few weeks by all but the most devoted movie buffs. So if you look at it from a financial standpoint, Transformers 3 should be considered one of the greatest films of all time.</p>
<h3>Movies that hit all the right spots</h3>
<p>Occasionally there is a movie that receives massive critical acclaim, can be watched over and over again without getting boring, and make a buttload of money. Avatar, Titanic, Toy Story 3. But in the grand scheme of things these movies are relatively rare. So I ask again:</p>
<p><strong><em>What makes a movie good?</em></strong></p>
