I am going to start reviewing all of the Coursera courses I am taking. This is a review of the first course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack" target="_blank">Full Stack Web Development Specialization</a>, titled 'HTML, CSS and JavaScript'. 

Quickie review is that the course isn't very good. 

For one thing it's $79, despite being half the length of most Coursera courses (three weeks as opposed to six). Which means you're over $25/week. From a pure ROI point of view, you could get a lot more information by signing up for Lynda or Code School or Treehouse for a month or so.

Content wise, it's not very good either. It's a very introductory course, so for me it was more than a bit boring to sit through, but I can't even recommend it for a complete noob as some of the information, in my opinion, is bad. For example, early on the instructor brings up various style tags. He does things like mention both <pre><em> and <i></pre> in the same lecture and states that they are 'exactly the same'. He doesn't really go into the semantic differences between them, which could lead someone who didn't know any better to assume they were identical and interchangeable. He also references w3Schools as a 'good resource' to learn from, which is just plain wrong (unless they've dramatically improved their content and no one told me). He also seems to highly rely on WYSWYG editors as learning tools? Like, you should use them to design a webpage, and then examine the source they produce to learn from? That is quite probably the worst way to learn HTML... I've yet to come across a WYSWYG editor that produces even remotely clean HTML. In general the first week a very limited overview of HTML and CSS. Enough to get someone pointed in the right direction I guess, but you'd learn more running through CodeCademy or something.

Second week is a little better. It serves as a crash course to JavaScript syntax. But not just syntax, the instructor tries to cover all essentially all of the basic computer science fundamentals. From variables to loops to functions, and beyond. Nothing he says is incorrect, but there's no way you can fit all of that into an hour or so worth of lectures. It comes off as very rushed and incomplete. If you've already got some programming experience then you'll just be bored. But if this was your first experience really programming anything, I think it'd be more confusing than anything. It's like he's not sure if he's teaching just a JS syntax class or an intro to CS class.

Third week is just more JS syntax. At least he doesn't try to rush through any more CS concepts. Again, all accurate information, and some good examples. Nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done.

So this course isn't good, but chances are you're not taking it standalone, you're taking it to as part of the specialization. Time will tell if the rest of the classes are good enough to justify the total price ($474 in total) or not. But if you're just looking for a standalone course to teach you the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, look elsewhere. There are much better options.
