A few weeks ago I posted that I was going to focus on JavaScript. At the time I meant it, I really do prefer JS syntax to Ruby. But the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/webapplications" target="_blank">Web Application Architectures</a> course on Coursera just launched and I really want to take it. It sounds like a solid class. And it uses Rails. So it's back to Ruby and RoR for the time being. Not that that's a bad thing. I had every intention of re-visiting Ruby in a few weeks anyway. This is just re-arranging my timetable a little bit. So for the meantime I will be putting JS stuff on hold and focusing on RoR. I think I will also use this as an excuse to re-write <a href="http://www.willcodeforfood.io" target="_blank">Will Code For Food</a> in Rails. I was originally planning on redoing using JS/Node, but this will probably work just as well. I will kind of use that as my 'capstone' project for this Coursera class (not that it requires one, it has it's own programming assignments). Again, not a huge deal, and if I couldn't adapt to change or being thrown into new frameworks unexpectedly I wouldn't be a very good developer now would I?

Speaking of Coursera, the second class of the<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing2/36" target="_blank"> Android Specialization</a> also started. And in a few days Advanced Software Development I starts through <a href="http://www.uat.edu/" target="_blank">UAT</a>. I actually have no idea what that class is about, but it sure sounds fancy. It doesn't even have a textbook to give me a clue. So, three fairly intensive classes at the same time. It's almost like I'm a real student. Time for some all nighters and pizza?
