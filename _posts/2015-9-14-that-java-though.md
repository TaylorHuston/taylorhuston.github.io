Been studying up on my Java. Haven't applied for the job at <a href="https://www.jivesoftware.com/" target="_blank">Jive Software</a> yet, wanted to refresh my Java first. Worked my way through the 2015 updated version of <a href="http://www.lynda.com/AllCertificates/User/1103034" target="_blank">Java Essential Training</a> on Lynda last week. And finally finish re-reading through <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/" target="_blank">Algorithms, 4th Ed</a>. Been slacking on that. 

Also, Coursera launched three new specializations this week. Well actually they released a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations" target="_blank">whole bunch</a>, but there are three I signed up for specifically; <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented?utm_medium=listingPage" target="_blank">Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures</a>, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack?utm_medium=listingPage" target="_blank">Full Stack Web Development</a> and the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ruby-on-rails?utm_medium=listingPage" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Web Development</a> specializations. 

I'm expecting the Java one to be mostly stuff I already know, as well as the early classes in the other two, but should hopefully still have some good information in them. Coursera did raise the price to $79 per class, which isn't too bad on it's own but when you're taking three at a time, it does add up. Still cheaper than tuition though. I've put the Cyberscurity specialization on hold for now. While it's still something I am interested in, I don't think it's "entry level" kind of work, and I don't want to stretch myself too thin. Four specializations (I'm still enrolled in the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mobilecloudcomputing2?utm_medium=listingPage" target="_blank">Mobile Cloud Computing with Android</a> one as well, though in-between classes at the monent), plus marathoning through the Lynda courses as well as just general textbook reading is already probably a bit much. If it turns out to be too much of a distraction and not a lot of new information, I may drop the Java one as it is. I'm still planning on getting my OCJP at some point, which would make the Java Specialization somewhat redundant.
