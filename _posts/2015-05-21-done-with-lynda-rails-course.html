<p>Well, like the title says, I finally finished the Lynda <a href="http://www.lynda.com/ViewCertificate/B415945D75004B3B88CD7A106F9F0112" target="_blank">Ruby On Rails 4 Essentials</a> course. Took me a lot longer than I thought. While it's just under 13 hours of video content in actuality it takes about twice that to get through it. You'll end up frequently pausing to copy down code, complete 'assignments', try things out, get a snack, etc. Still, I can't recommend the course enough. I found it much more comprehensive than either the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/webapplications-003" target="_blank">Coursera course</a> (which I am STILL waiting on them to finish grading so I can get my certificate that I paid for) or <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Hartl's tutorial</a> (which I haven't finished yet). While I am definitely not an expert, I feel like I am now at the point where I could interview for a Jr. Rails Developer position and not make a total fool out of myself. So it's time to polish up my resume and start sending it out.</p>
<p>In the meantime I am going to jump back to more traditional Computer Science stuff. I have CS:318 - Software Engineering Principles and CS:313 - Operating System Principles coming up in a few weeks through UAT. I want to finish up <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/" target="_blank">Algorithms, 4th Ed</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Java-Program-Early-Objects-Edition/dp/0133807800" target="_blank">Java: How To Program</a> before they start. Java is still my favorite language to work in. Very C++ like, except not quite so picky. I'm seriously considering getting my OracleÂ Certified Java Programmer. I know that certs aren't looked highly on by developers (well specifically the developers in r/cscareerquestions), but I think having something on paper from a recognized institution wouldn't be a bad thing, considering I still won't have on-paper C.S. degree.</p>
<p>I also need to finish up the Rails version of <a href="http://willcodeforfood.io/" target="_blank">my job board</a>. It's almost ready for launch, I think. Few more tweaks and it should be good. I still think it will be a great portfolio piece.</p>
