I use a weird, hover my hands over the keyboard and use primarily my pointer and index fingers to type style of typing. Kind of like hunt-and-peck without the hunt part. It works decently well. When I am on a good streak and I am typing something simple (ie not code) I can probably break 60 wpm.

But when I try and type the 'proper' way, the fingers on home-row, all that jazz, my typing speed goes to crap. I never took a typing class in High School. I've just always used computers and developed my own typing style that worked for me. But after getting frustrated with having to look at the keyboard occasionally to re-orientate my hands and about how inefficient my typing sometimes becomes when I was trying to type code I thought that maybe I should learn the proper way. So I signed up for a <a href="http://www.typing.com/" target="_blank">Typing.com</a> account, did the lessons, and then remembered why I never followed through on learning it before. It's incredibly painful for me. The reason I keep my hands hovering over the keyboard, slightly to the sides, instead on the keyboard on home row at all times is because it causes my right wrist to have horrible pains. Now this is my mousing wrist and it's given me trouble for years. It used to hurt all the time. A while back I took to wearing a brace on it at night and using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-910-001799-M570-Wireless-Trackball/dp/B0043T7FXE">this mouse</a> for all my non-gaming mousing needs, and that worked for the most part. No more constant wrist pain. But trying to do the home-row thing still aggravates it. According to Typing.com, typing the 'proper' way, I am averaging an abysmal 27wpm. And my right wrist is killing me. I have been trying to force myself to do it, thinking maybe it was just an adjustment period, but it's not looking so hot.

I know this isn't critical. Being a speed typist isn't necessary to being a good programmer. But I'm sure it helps. And I am worried I will go into an interview and make a fool of myself with my modified quick hunt-and-peck style of typing one day. I've thought about surgery, but everything I've read tells me that's only a last resort. So I am going to try doing a lesson or two on Typing.com every day for another week or so, see if the pain fades. If it doesn't I may have to start looking into investing in a nice ergonomic, or even a split, keyboard. It really feels like it wouldn't be nearly as much of an issue if my hands were farther apart. While I love my Razer mechanical keyboard, it may be time to retire it for some other options.
