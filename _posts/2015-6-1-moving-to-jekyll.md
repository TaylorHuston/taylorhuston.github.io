It's been a few weeks since my last post. The main reason for that is because I have been in the process of converting my blog over to Jekyll. If this is your first time here, it used to be a WordPress blog. I just want to start off saying that I don't mind WordPress. I mean, it's not perfect. PHP is such an ugly language, and WordPress had a tendency to mess up some of the formatting of my pages/posts, but for the most part it still really is the best blogging platform out there, IMHO. But I figured having my personal portfolio site as WordPress wouldn't win my any points with other developers. Something like Jekyll, I think, will give me a bit more 'geek cred'. And I can definitely see the appeal of something like Jekyll. It's really lightweight and super flexible. Perfect for something technical, like the personal blog/portfolio of a developer. And I am have just scratched the surface of it I am sure, so I am willing to bet there's a lot of cool tricks I haven't discovered yet. I still need to learn Liquid for templateing, and some other things, but so far I enjoy it.

That being said, it's not for everyone. Anyone non-technical should still just use WordPress. Or even someone technical, who wants something quick. If I started another, non-technocal blog, say about movies or cooking or whatever, I'd probably just use WordPress. It's quick, easy and get's the job done. Plus WordPress has the advantage of having web-based editing. So far I have been doing all of the writing on my local machine using [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) and just pushing it up. Which is fine for now, but I am going to look into using [Prose](http://prose.io/) or something in the future. 

At least it was relatively easy to import all of my posts and content. Not everything copied over perfectly, the posts brough a lot of meta data with them that wasn't used, and the pages were put in the wrong directoy, but it got me 90% of the way there.

Plus now everytime I add or edit a post it get's marked on GitHub, which makes my commit log all that more active ;).
