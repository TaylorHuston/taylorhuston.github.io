This is a review of the second course of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack" target="_blank">Full Stack Web Development Specialization</a>, titled 'Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools'.

The first three weeks of this course is essentially a Bootstrap course. Nothing fancy, just build a simple website while progressively adding some Bootstrap functionality.

The fourth week is kind of random. Introduces a bunch of concepts for things that will be in later classes. Node, LESS/SASS, Bower, etc. Brief introduction, no real details about any of them. Felt a bit like a filler week.

This was a good class. Much better than the precious one in this sequence. Different instructor, much more knowledgable and charismatic. For $79 you could probably save the time and money and just read the actual Bootstrap documentation, but it's not a bad course. I had never really used Bootstrap before, so I learned a lot.
