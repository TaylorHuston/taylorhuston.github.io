It's been a bit since I've posted. Been kind of a heavy/busy last couple of weeks.

In my first post I briefly mentioned that there were some health issues in my family, which was in no small part one of my inspirations for taking my career a bit more seriously. Well I bring it up now because those health issues have cropped back up. Specifically my sister has ovarian cancer, and it was in remission, but it's came back with a vengeance. Last week they started her on a four month aggressive chemo plan. Pretty scary stuff. While I plan on keeping this blog as 'professional' as possible (won't see any posts about my views on politics, of which I have many, or anything like that), I felt as if I should mention since it is a pretty big thing. Been mainly dealing with that for the last few weeks. My immediate gut reaction was, of course, to throw everything I could into my car and drive up to Alaska to be near her while she's going through this. 

That's a big reason as to why I've kept the job I have as long as I have. Working from home is kind of a wash. Yes the commute is fantastic, but man do I miss human contact. But having a telecommute job has made it easy to hop on a plane back home whenever I want to go visit. I have been going up a few times a year. Christmas, the State Fair, I drove up one summer and my sister and I just spent three months hiking and camping and zip-lining and all the Alaskan things. 

But I am getting off-topic. Of course if I went to Alaska that would put a hold on any job hunting or other life-progress. I wouldn't even get that much self studying done. Between wanting to spend time with her, my nephew, my mom, I never get anything productive done while I am up there. Plus I always spend way too much money up there as well. I talked to my sister, a lot, and she assures me it's 'not that serious'. She'd much rather have me focused on doing the things I need to do. She has always been my biggest supporter. So as of right now I have no plans to drop everything and fly up there.

In other news, I've put a lot of work into <a href="http://www.willcodeforfood.io/" target="_blank">Will Code For Food</a>. I've got a solid, if pretty basic MVP up and online that people can register for, post jobs, browse, etc. It's still very much a Beta, but I am proud of it. Very excited to keep working on it. I've basically re-watched the entire <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-4-Essential-Training/139989-2.html" target="_blank">Lynda Rails</a> course and been applying the steps to Will Code For Food.

I started CS318 - Software Engineering Principles through UAT. It's a team based class, groups of 5 working together to plan and eventually build a simple application. Naturally I volunteered to be Lead Developer and to build the project in Rails. Reading wise, it's a pretty heavy workload course. Few chapters from the textbook along with several external PDFs each week. I think that's going to be taking up most of my time over the next few weeks.

I've also started a <a href="https://iwritecodeslack.herokuapp.com/" target="blank">Public Slack Room</a> for programmers and developers to come hang out in. Been finding difficulty in getting the word out about it. I posted it to some Subreddits, where it was immediately downvoted, because Reddit, as well as some programmer/developer Facebook groups I belong to. As of right now I've had over 40 people sign up, though there are usually less than 10 on at any given time. I hope to change that over time, I think it could be a great community for developers to meet, ask question, swap ideas, etc. Kind of like IRC but with a better interface. Time will tell if it takes off or not.
