Christmas time is here. I also can't believe it's been almost a year since I started this blog. I really feel that I've come a long way. Other than that, not much to report, I just hadn't made a non-review post in a while so I thought I'd check in.

Back up in Alaska for the holidays. While I do love visitng here and seeing my family, it is hard to get any studying done. A lot of distractions. I pushed the third classes for the two Coursera specializations I am in to the January start dates. I just knew I wouldn't have time to work on them while I was up here. There are some other things I wanted to work on anyway. CodeCademy has some Rails and Angular courses now I wanted to work through really quick. I am also reading through <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/angularjs-example" target="_blank">AngulrJs By Example</a> a little bit at a time when I get a chance. Beyond that I've mainly just been spending time with my adorable nephew, and trying not to freeze to death. I probably won't post again until after the holidays, so I guess I will see you all in 2016!
