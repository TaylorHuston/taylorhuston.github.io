<p>I've recently had a case of eating my own words.</p>
<p>I've always thought Apple products were all flash, no substance. Could never see why anyone would want to buy one. Then I went and got myself a Macbook Pro...and I love it.</p>
<p>I have a Windows desktop because I like to build my machines and tweak my hardware. I'm a PC gamer. I regularly swap and overclock video cards, add more ram, move my fans around trying to maximize airflow. My first computer was a Gateway my mom bought for me, every one I've had since I built myself.</p>
<p>But when it came for me to replace my last laptop I opted for a 13" MBP. And, as far as laptops go, it's a dream. It's the only trackpad I've ever actually enjoyed using. I recently used it as my daily driver when I was visiting family for the holidays for 3 weeks and I didn't have to use my wireless mouse once. The screen is gorgeous, obviously. As a web developer, terminal is super helpful. Now I can test things on Safari if I need to. I would also like to get into iOS development at some point so Xcode was a must.</p>
<p>Build wise it is by far the nicest laptop I've ever owned. That being said, I've never owned a 'premium' laptop before. In the past almost all of my computer budget has gone to my beastly desktop, with whatever left over going towards a low end, possibly refurbished "I just need something to browse the internet and maybe write a little code on" laptop. I know that for the same $1300 I could have gotten a 'premium' Windows laptop with higher specs, even a higher resolution screen, but that's the Apple tax for you.</p>
<p>OS wise, it's a wash. They both have some really good things, and they both have some really infuriating things. Terminal is great. Finder is horrible. I actually don't mind Launchpad while I hate Windows 8 Live Tiles (though that could just be because I am so used to Start doing a thing that I just don't like it no longer doing that thing). So to each their own in that regard. Obviously I am still an OSX noob, but it does feel like OSX deserves the "easier to use but not as powerful/customizable" reputation I've heard over the years. If I could only choose one, I would go with Windows just for that reason, but the next computer I buy my mom will be an Apple. Click and drag to install is right about her maximum technical ability.</p>
<p>I don't think I'll ever buy a Mac desktop. The iMac still makes no sense to me. A desktop that uses laptop parts? The Mac Pro is nice to look at, but WAY overpriced. And I'm a diehard Android fan, way too invested in the ecosystem to change now. But I could see myself only buying Macbooks from now on for my laptops.</p>
