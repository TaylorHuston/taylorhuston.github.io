I've decided that, for the time being, I am going to focus most of my web related studying on JavaScript (and it's various libraries). I was working through <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/users/6736" target="_blank">The Odin Project</a>, which is definitely a great project and a great curriculum, but it's primarily Ruby?rails focused. Not that there's anything wrong with Ruby, that was my first exposure to it and I can certainly see why people like it. But coming from a C++/Java background, I just find the syntax of JavaScript to be much more intuitive. Curly brackets, semicolons, all that jazz.

I'm sure I will revisit The Odin Project at some point, as well as Ruby in general, but I don't want to spread myself too thin. I think the biggest hurdle of self-teaching is getting distracted, is not knowing where to start or where to go next. You start learning one thing, hear about something else, jump to that, etc. Eventually you know the first 10% of a bunch of different topics, and not enough to actually do anything in any of them. So Rails is going on the back burner for now. Right now I'm still juggling learning JavaScript for web dev, keeping up to date on Java for <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/" target="_blank">Algorithms (Coursera)</a>, and in a few weeks the second section of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing2/36" target="_blank">Android Specialization</a> starts. Plus the classes from <a href="http://www.uat.edu/" target="_blank">UAT </a>I am auditing. I was supposed to be auditing Compilers starting this week, but the class was cancelled (not enough enrollment?) so I have a breather from that for the next 5 weeks. Throwing Ruby in the mix now is probably a bad idea.

So getting back to JavaScript. I am already decently familiar with it. I've used it for some basic stuff at my job for a while now. I've done the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/pyCoder84523" target="_blank">CodeCademy </a>JavaScript and jQuery courses (which were a little dry but they got the job done). I've done some of the JavaScript courses through <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/taylorhuston" target="_blank">Treehouse </a>the free intro JavaScript and jQuery classes from <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/1207974" target="_blank">CodeSchool</a>. I actually really enjoyed the Code School ones and I was planning on subscribing to them and continuing down the track until I remember that Udacity has some as part of their <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001" target="_blank">Front End Web Developer Nanodegree</a>. I like Udacity, I think their online platform is great and all of the classes from them I've dabbled in have had really charismatic instructors. I do think their time estimates are a little off. For example, their <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud804" target="_blank">JavaScript Basics</a> course is supposed to take three weeks, but it's only about 2 hours or so worth of videos. I did it in an evening. I mean, I'm not exactly a beginner, but still...

The other classes I've taken from them had similarly generous estimates. Right now I am just marathoning through the classes themselves. I'm not actually signed up for the 'Nanodegree' program. While I like what they are trying to accomplish, I'm just not sold that $200/mo is a justifiable price when all of the actual lectures and coursework is completely free. Granted it's still a helluva lot cheaper than college tuition, but $200 is still $200. Now according to the FAQ you can complete it as fast as you want. The next enrollment opens on March 4th, by then I should have had more than enough time to complete all of the actual classes in it, so I may enroll for a month, just long enough to submit all of my projects and earn the certificate. We'll see how I feel in March.

And, holding to my philosophy that books are the best way to learn, I picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Node-js-MongoDB-AngularJS-Development-Developers/dp/0321995783#" target="_blank">Node.js, MongoDB, and AngularJS Web Development (Developer's Library)</a> through Safari Books and have been reading through that. Not too deep into it yet but so far it seems like a decently written book. I doubt it will make me an expert on any of those topics, but it should give me a broad enough overview of all of them and how they interact that I can then dive deeper with more specific books and tutorials.
