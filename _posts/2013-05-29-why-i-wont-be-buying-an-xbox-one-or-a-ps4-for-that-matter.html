<p>So earlier this month Microsoft officially revealed the Xbox one and the internet rose up and gave a collective 'meh'.  To say that response to the reveal has been lukewarm would be being too kind.</p>
<p>I consider myself a gamer.  I spent my childhood glued to my NES and SNES.  I spent my teenage years glued to my N64 and PS1.  I have owned every Nintendo home console, every Sega console starting with the Genesis, and all three Playstations.  I still have my Dreamcast hooked up.  I still play my old Ps1 RPGs (probably my favorite games) when I get bored.  I am a gamer.  And I have no interest in the next generation of gaming consoles.  Don't get my wrong, the tech specs of the next Xbox are very impressive.  I'm sure the PS4 will be even more powerful.  State of the art...for about 6 months, and therein lies the problem.</p>
<p>In addition to being a console gamer I have also always been a PC gamer.  For most of my life those have been two separate entities.  PC was for my keyboard and mouse strategy games and my FPSs.  My Warcrafts, Diablos and Quakes.  Consoles were for my twitch reflex adventure games.  My Sonic the Hedgehogs and Metroid Primes.  But over the last few years that has changed and the two worlds have definitely merged.</p>
<p>To clarify, for the purpose of this article when I say console I am going to be referring to then 'hardcore' consoles, the Playstations and the Xboxs (Xboxes?).  It still sounds strange not including Nintendo in with the 'real' consoles, but that's how it feels nowadays, Nintendo does their own thing, which I will bring up later on in this post.</p>
<p>But getting back to the point, nowadays most games are released for the Xbox 360, PS3 and the PC.  Not only are they released for all 3, but they look better on my PC.  Plain and simple.  Except for maybe a very brief period of time after a new console is released, my PC will always have better hardware and better graphics.  If a game is released for a console and the PC, there is no reason for my to buy it for the console.  L</p>
<p>Here are some of the reasons I USED to buy consoles:</p>
<p>Console Specific Games:  We just went over that.  Back in the day they had their own games, but now for the most part any game I want to play I can get for my PC.  On my PC it will look better, it will have mods, and I can play it for years to come (more on that later).  The <em>occasional</em> console exclusive title isn't enough to change that.</p>
<p>Social Play:  The other nice thing about playing console games used to be the social aspect.  Having some friends come over after school and playing together (ie the 4 way deathmatches on Goldeneye, taking turns trying to beat levels in Mega Man 2).  But that was before broadband, that was before Battle.net, that was before I was almost 30.  This is the one corner of the market where Nintendo still has the advantage.  If I do want to have some friends come over we are going to do something like play drunken Wii bowling.  Now there are some sports and fighting games out there that I guess could still make the argument for in-person social play, but I am not a particularly huge fan of those genres, and I don't think they are enough reason to buy a several hundred dollar console.</p>
<p>Now the disadvantages of consoles:</p>
<p>Backwards Compatibility:  Apparently the Xbox One will not only not play any Xbox or 360 games, but will not even play XBLA games.  I am lucky enough that I snagged one of the old PS3s that can play PS2 games, and I dread the day it dies.  If I spend my money on a game, I want to be able to play that game years down the line if I feel like it, without having to dig some old console out of my closet and pray it still works.  If I buy a game for my PC I know that I can play it anytime I want on any PC I own for the forseeable future.  A PC pretty much has unlimited backwards compatibility.  Even some old DOS game you may have lying around, you may need to fiddle with it a little, but you can probably get it to work.  If I buy a game on Steam today, I am confident that I can play that game anytime I want regardless of how often I upgrade or replace my PC.</p>
<p>Mods:  A relatively new aspect, but an important one nonetheless is mods.  Mods for PC games have really taken off.  There are mods for everything.  And some of them are really fun.  Not having mods certainly isn't a dealbreaker, but it is certainly a nice option to have.</p>
<p>Upgradeable:  I can upgrade my PC.  I frequently do.  That's usually where my tax return goes each year.  As powerful as a new console is at launch day, technology just moves too fast for a locked in system to succeed.  10 years ago this was less of an issue, but unless the PS4 has the ability to swap out it's graphics card or add more RAM, I just don't see it competing with a PC.</p>
<p>Back to the Xbox One.  I didn't get into Kinect.  When I am playing a video game it's because I want to sit down and be lazy.  If I want to stand up and move around I will go outside.  That's actually the reason I was less then sold on the Wii at first, but that grew on me.  The Wii motion controls are kind of fun without requiring you to dance around your living room.  So a new, better, more precise, slightly creepy Kinect has no appeal to me.</p>
<p>Getting back into the backwards compatibility, I think that's a huge negative.  I am not one of them, but a lot of people out there are really invested into their XBLA library.  And XBLA games, with typically shorter, fun gameplay, I think lend themselves to replay-ability more then big money AAA console titles.  I like Fable, I beat it, it was a fun game, I am never going to play it again.  A game like Castle Crashers on the other hand...  Also it just doesn't feel right.  Backwards compatibility with physical games can be justified.  Different console architecture, some things may not be compatible.  And it wouldn't surprise me if in the relatively near future they start adding Xbox One playable versions of original Xbox and Xbox360 games to XBLA.  Sucks having to buy the same game twice, but understandable.  But they can't do that with XBLA games, not without pissing a lot of people off.  Having to pay to download a game you already paid to download?  While technically it makes sense, current gen XBLA titles may not be compatible with Xbox One hardware for the exact same reason that 360 games aren't compatible with Xbox One hardware, it just feels wrong.</p>
<p>The home media center aspects of the Xbox One are cool, in theory.  I am not upset at Microsoft for adding them.  They just don't appeal to me.  While they are cool, they're not anything super revolutionary.  Their not anything I NEED to have.  It's a lot of things that Tivo an Smart TVs are already doing, or will be doing shortly.  And as a member of the ever growing minority of people that just don't watch cable most of them are things I would never use.  I watch Netflix and Hulu.  I won't pay for a cable package that includes HBO, but I would probably pay for some kind of streaming HBO service.  I think that's the direction media is going in general.  Maybe the Xbox One will make it easier to consume media that way, maybe, but it's not presented itself as a device you NEED to have to do so.  DVRS and multi tuners don't affect that.  I'm not pissed like a lot of the internet, but I am thoroughly un-intrigued.</p>
<p>I can see how some people with money to burn, who watch a lot of tv, are possible really into sports, may end up buying it.  But it doesn't seem to be targeted to me, the gamer.</p>
<p>So, to reiterate, I have no desire to spend $399 on a console that only does things my PC already does better.  Plain and simple.  Now if they come out with just some ridiculously fantastic Xbox exclusive titles, and they drop the price, and let me port over XBLA titles, then maybe?  I don't plan on buying either console, though the chances of Sony changing my mind with some really interesting exclusive titles (maybe some Final Fantasy games which I can never say no to) are slightly higher then Microsoft, but still unlikely.  Just the fact that it's a new console is no longer enough reason for me justify the purchase.  A new console has to bring something truly unique to the table that a PC just cannot do.</p>
<p>Until then I have no problem running an HDMI cable to my tv and playing all the Steam, and I don't see that changing anytime soon.</p>
