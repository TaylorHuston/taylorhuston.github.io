I am going to start reviewing all of the Coursera courses I am taking. This is a review of the first course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Web Development Specialization</a>, titled 'Ruby on Rails: An Introduction'. 

I am pretty impressed with this class. I was worried at first, the first week is literally just 'how to set up Ruby' videos for Windows, OSX and Linux, and then a quick overview of Git. Not a single line of code. Considering it's a three week course, I was a little worried I wouldn't be getting much for my money.

The second week picked up though. Was a good overview of all of the Ruby you will need to get started using Rails. Did a pretty good job of covering all the bases. Now it obviously couldn't go TOO into depth into a lot of things, and doesn't try to. It definitely assumes you already have some objected orientated programming experience, that you know (conceptually) what classes and inheritance and all that jazz is. But if you're already a programmer, this will give you enough Ruby syntax to get started. It also came with a very nice repo of a lot of good Ruby examples that I am sure I will reference a lot in the future. Even includes a quick primer on RSpec.

Third week was a quick overview of Rails. It's a fairly basic introduction. Doesn't even go into databases or migrations (mentions them, but makes a point that it's something that is coming in a later class). But it's enough to get someone who hadn't ever used Rails before on the right path. Not enough for them to even be able to create their own complete Rails app from the ground up or anything, but enough that they can start reading the documentation and learning what they would need to. The final project was actually fairly interesting. Wasn't too complicated, but it was the first time I've ever used a third part API to retrieve data, so that was fun. It also touched on black box testing with Capybara. It didn't go into a lot of detail about it, but at least now I am aware of it's existence so I know to look more into it when I get the chance.

In summary: This class alone probably isn't worth the $79 price tag, not for only three weeks. The quality is very good, but the amount of information for the price isn't there. At over $25 per week there are better options. Of course, judging it purely based on the number of weeks may not be the best way. While it was only three weeks, each of those weeks did contain a fair amount of information. By contrast, the other, unrelated <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/webapplications" target="_blank">Coursera Rails course</a> I took was twice as long, but actually contained less total information. On the other hand, for $25 you could subscribe to Lynda.com for a month, take their 6 hour Ruby Essentials course and their 12 hour Rails Essentials courses, both of which which went a lot deeper, and then when you were done take any one of the other numerous Web Dev courses through them. But you're probably not looking at this course in a vacuum. You're looking at it as part of the entire Rails specialization, and time will tell if that ends up being worth it. My feeling right now is that you're going to be partly paying for the recognition that comes with completing an entire Coursera Specialization on a subject from a well recognixed institution. On a pure information per dollar rate, there are better options, but those might not look as good on a resume. I'm going to continue with the specialization, because I want to put it on my resume. If I was already working as a Rails or Web Developer and was only taking it for personal growth, I'd look elsewhere, or maybe just take the courses and not pay for the actual certificate. The only other complaint I had, and this isn't really a complaint, is that the guy talks kind of slow. I'm sure that's helpful for some people, but I was able to bump the playback speed up to 1.75x and still follow along fine.
