<p>When I was a kid in a small fishing village in Alaska. Had never been exposed to politics or anything even remotely close to it. One day, I couldn't have been older to 9 or 10, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jeff.wheaton" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/user.php?id=1211460962">Jeff Wheaton</a> was teaching us about the basics of economics, and one of the first things we were taught was about how there has to be a set amount of money for an economy to work. After all, if your print an infinite amount of of money, then money becomes worthless.</p>
<p>I remember thinking that "wait, if there is only so much money to go around, and all of the rich people have it, then there isn't enough left over for the rest and that's why there is poor people."  Simple math, even to a child.</p>
<p>I was also hooked on the Captain Planet cartoons. When I was a kid I used to get angry at cars that had dual exhaust pipes because, in my mind, 2x exhaust pipes = 2x the pollution. Makes sense when your 7.</p>
<p>I remember watching movies where gays and lesbians were discriminated against or ridiculed, and legitimately thinking that "that only happens in movies now, not in real life". The fact that it was even still an issue never crossed my mind.</p>
<p>Every one of the above statements is true. Not making any of it up or exaggerating. The fact is, I was a liberal years before I even understood the concept of what a liberal was. I was literally born this way.</p>
