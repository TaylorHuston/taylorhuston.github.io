I finished the <a href="http://www.lynda.com/home/CertificateOfCompletion/CertificationStatus.aspx" target="_blank">Lynda Android</a> course. I was less than impressed with it compared to some of the other Lynda courses I've taken. It was from a different instructor. It's not that the information is bad, it just skimmed over a lot of important things. For example, in one of the first videos he is explaining what the AndroidManifet file is. During that short video he mentions that that is the file where you would place any permissions needed, and then never mentions permissions again in the entire course. He briefly mentions fragments in one video, but doesn't go into detail (though apparently there is another Lynda course specifically on that topic). He starts using Intents without ever explaining what they are, conceptually. I suppose it's a good intro to Android development, but it's by no means enough to start actually developing your own apps. If anything it did show me some Android Studio tips and tricks that I wasn't aware of. The Coursera course is still using the older Eclipse based videos.

I've also started taking a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto" target="_blank">Stanford Cryptography</a> class through Coursera. It's not actually part of their Cybersecurity specialization, but I figured taking it as well couldn't hurt.

Other than that I haven't gotten a whole lot done. Mainly spending time with my family, hanging out with my new nephew. Man he makes me want to move back to Alaska, too bad that would be career suicide.
