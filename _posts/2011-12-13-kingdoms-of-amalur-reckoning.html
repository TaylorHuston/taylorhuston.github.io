<p>So I am ridiculously excited for <strong>Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning.  </strong>It has a stellar team behind it, the early reviews look really promising, but what I am most excited about is that the storyline is being written by R.A. Salvatore.  Salvatore is a New York Times bestselling author, so I am sure most of you have came across his books at one time or another.  But if you haven't you should.  Go to the bookstore now and buy The Crystal Shard.  Go on.  Right now.  I'll wait.</p>
<p>I got a used copy of The Crystal Shard when I was like 8, I think, and it completely opened my eyes and ignited my love of fantasy novels.  And all of his other books have been equally fantastic.  So a AAA game written by him is basically my wet dream.  And it's not like he just penned a quick story-line overview in a notebook for the design team.  He has supposedly laid out of 10,000 years of history and lore for this world (probably to leave things open for sequels, prequels, etc).  The project eventually started out as an MMO, and even though it is now a single-player RPG there is still rumored to be an MMO based on it in the works...so yeah...social lives are overrated anyways.</p>
<p>Anyways, check out this interview with the producer of the game and bask in it's awesomeness.</p>
