Wow it has been a while since I have posted. Sorry about that. I'd like to say it's because I've been busy, but really it's that I haven't had anything particularly exciting to talk about.

I've finished up the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/angular-js/home/welcome" target="_blank">third class in the Full Stack Coursera specialization</a>. Look for a review of that coming soon. I've been meaning to start the third course in the Rails specialization, but I've been pushing that back. It's not that I don't enjoy working with Rails, I really do, but from what I have been reading the job market for that doesn't seem too hot right now, and I didn't want to spread myself too thin. Also on that note I didn't want to stray too far from the fundamental CS stuff that I need to know for interviews. Which is a nice transition onto the other thing that I have been working on. UAT didn't have a dedicated Discrete Math class as part of their curriculum, something I didn't think was, so over the last month I have been working through <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs70/sp15/" target="_blank">UC Berkeley's CS 70</a> class. They have all of the lectures online through iTunes U, along with all of the homework (with solutions) and midterms on the archived course website. 28 lectures, so one a night, wasn't too difficult.

Other than that it's just been self studying the MEAN stack. It seems like that and Java are the two hottest areas right now, the two areas with the most job opportunities. I haven't really been actively job hunting though. I mean, I have a job, so it's not like I am in a 'if I don't get a job soon I will be homeless and starving' situation. Plus I have been really busy at my job, after the holidays we started several projects that have been keeping me well into overtime territory. And I have a few ideas for some side projects I want to launch first. Not only will they look good on a resume (I think), but they might even make me some extra money on the side. Don't put all your eggs in one basket, especially where your money is concerned. But once those are done I think it will be time to start spamming out the resumes.
