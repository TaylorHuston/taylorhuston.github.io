Another milestone, 60 straight days of contributing to my <a href="https://github.com/TaylorHuston" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I'm quite proud of myself. I also finished both the Coursera <a href="https://class.coursera.org/webapplications-003" target="_blank">Rails </a>and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/3EV3GP8MUW" target="_blank">Android</a> courses I was taking. Should have gotten verified certificates in both (still waiting for the Rails course to finish processing I think). Speaking of Rails, I'm continually impressed with <a href="http://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Lynda</a>. I finished their <a href="http://www.lynda.com/ViewCertificate/E2C415354F124097B7F4422CADA35F49" target="_blank">Ruby Essentials</a> course, and am about halfway through their <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-4-Essential-Training/139989-2.html" target="_blank">Rails 4 Essentials</a> course. Both courses are top-notch. The Coursera Rails course wasn't bad, but it was honestly pretty light. For a 6 week course there just wasn't a lot of content. You could easily power through it in a weekend if you wanted to. I'm only halfway through the Lynda Rails course and it's already covered twice as much information. Barring any surprises I should have it done by the end of tomorrow.

The next course in the Android Specialization started almost immediately after the last. I actually would have been happy if there was more of a break between the two, give me some time to keep focusing on Rails, and maybe finally finish the second part of the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/algs4partII-005/" target="_blank">Algorithms</a> course from Coursera. It technically doesn't end for another 9 days, but it's not a verified course or anything so there really isn't a time limit.

Ugh, only so many hours in a day.
