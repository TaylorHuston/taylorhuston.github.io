Couple of new things this week. I started the Operating Systems course through UAT. That's fairly interesting so far. The textbook is thick and comprehensive, and more importantly free. UAT has been doing a good job of providing free eText versions of their textbooks lately. The interface isn't always the best, but free is free. Beats the $150+ asking price on Amazon. The first class of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/androidpart1" target="_blank">Coursera Android specialization</a> restarted as well, so I'm taking it again because, why not? I'm interested to see if it's been updated at all. When I first took it the videos were already over a year old. Still on Android 4.0. Using Ecplise with ADT and not even mentioning Android Studio, etc. Beyond that I'm still trucking through <a href="http://www.lynda.com/AllCertificates/User/1103034" targer="_blank">Lynda courses</a>. Been alternating between courses from their 'Foundations of Programming' track and some of their web development specific ones. Already busted out the HTML, CSS and JavaScript ones for review. Still need to take the jQuery one, but I want to do their Android Development Essentials one first. It was just refreshed a few weeks ago, so it's all Android Lollipop and Android Studio. It should be a nice complement to the Coursera course.

On a personal note I'm going up to Alaska for a month to visit family next week. Do my (possibly last) annual trip? I say possibly last because when I get back I am going to start seriousy job hunting. Ideally I will have a new job shortly, and I don't know if that new job will allow me to take off a month during the summer. We shall see what the future holds. In either case I'm excited to see my sister and my nephew.
