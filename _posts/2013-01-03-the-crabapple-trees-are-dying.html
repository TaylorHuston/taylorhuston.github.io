<p>Christmas is my favorite time of year.  Always has been.  And not because of presents (not that presents aren't awesome) but because of the memories.</p>
<p>We used to always have Christmas at my grandparent's (mother's side) house in Wasilla, AK.  It's a nice house on a gorgeous 40-acre property.  My grandpa got it when it was nothing but trees, cleared it, made a runway for his airplane (he was a bush pilot).  By the time he was done it had two houses, a greenhouse, a barn and an airplane hanger.  It is my favorite place in the world.  Because of the memories.  My mom married and divorced twice, we moved around a bit, but we always had 'The Homestead' as we called it.</p>
<p>I have so many fond childhood memories of that place.  In the winter my grandpa used to use his tractor to pile up all the snow from the property into a big hill and we would turn it into the best snow fort ever.  In the summer my cousin and I would spend hours 4-wheeling in the trails behind the house.  We would go hang out at this mystery tree fort we found in the woods.  No idea who built it but it's always been there.  Not even a little bit safe, but we didn't care.  When I got older there is a pond back there that I may or may not have taken a few girls to for skinny dipping.  But out of all those memories my favorite was always Christmas.</p>
<p>My grandma and aunt would cook for days.  We would have a ridiculous amount of people crammed into the house.  Family.  Friends of family.  Friends of family's children.  Big ol' Christmas tree in the living room surrounded by a sea of presents.  Presents as far as the eye can see.  It was epic.  And we don't do it anymore and I can't begin to explain how sad that makes me.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my point.  The crabapple trees are dying.  When I was a kid my grandpa planted three crapabble trees in the yard and I watched them grow my entire life.  They grew with my sister and I.  We are the youngest two of six grandkids, and the only ones to ever actually live on the property.  We lived there for a while after my mom divorced my dad when I was three, and then we moved back after she divorced her third husband when I was 14, and lived there ever since.  When I came back to visit for the holidays this time I was shocked to see that one of the trees had died and already been cut down, and the other two won't make it to next season.</p>
<p>I think it all started when my grandpa passed away.  A few years later my grandma bought a small house in town so it would be easier for her to get around and for her friends to come over.  All of my older cousins grew up, got married, started families of their own, moved away, etc.  Every year Christmas became smaller and smaller.  Now we have it at my aunt's house and it's not nearly as big as it used to be.  This year my sister worked on Christmas Eve and we went and bugged her instead of even going to my aunt's for dinner.  We did stop by to say hi later, but only for a minute.  It just wasn't the same.</p>
<p>I understand that that's life.  Things change.  People move on.  And normally that doesn't bother me, but every year that we don't have Christmas on The Homestead like we used to get I get a little sad inside.  The crabapple trees are dying, and in a way it feels like my childhood is dying with them.</p>
