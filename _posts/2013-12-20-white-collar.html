<p>I LOVE White Collar.  Probably my favorite tv show currently airing.  But I will be the first to admit it is getting a little repetitive and at some times even sloppy.  The whole 'end each season on some kind of a cliffhanger just to wrap up everything up and return to the status quo 15 minutes into the next season premier' thing is getting old.  I would have liked a few episodes of Neal on the run internationally in season 4 before returning.  Maybe a few episodes of Peter in prison before they find a way to clear his name in this season.  But nope.  Despite the fact that in season 3 Peter was fully advocating for Neal to be released, now he's back to not trusting him and obsessively checking his anklet?  Why?  Because that's the dynamic of the show and the writers seem to be following the 'if it ain't broke don't fix it' motto as closely as possible.</p>
<p>Neal should be off anklet by now.  It made sense the first season or two but now it's just a poorly used gimmick.  It has no impact on the show, we all know that Neal could run anytime he wants anyways.  The tension it was designed to create just no longer applies.  Better to have him off anklet but still coming into work at the FBI every day of his own volition, show how he has grown as a person as a result of the father/son relationship he's formed with Peter over the show.  And maybe show that a little bit of Neal has rubbed off on Peter as well, make him a little more apt to bend the law in the name of justice when necessary.</p>
<p>As much as I love the show, if they don't use this season to shake things up I may lose interest at not return for season 6.</p>
