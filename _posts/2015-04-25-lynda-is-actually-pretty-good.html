<p>I'm sure if you're reading this you've seen at least on YouTube pre-roll ad for <a href="http://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">Lynda.com</a>. And I am here to tell you that if you've been on the fence about signing up, you should probably do it. Just to get this out of the way, I'm not like connected to Lynda in anyway, I don't have an affiliate partnership or anything, not making any money for referring people to them. I just recently re-signed up for their service and, so far, have been really impressed. I actually had an account with them a while back and cancelled it, for some reason. Can't remember why. But I wanted to watch some of their photography videos for fun, so I signed up for a month. Had every intention of cancelling it before it renewed, but now I am definitely going to keep it for a while.</p>
<p>I started off by watching one of their <a href="http://www.lynda.com/ViewCertificate/EE3205CDCCCC447499193AD792CAA02B" target="_blank">photography classes</a>. Just started playing it while I ironed a bunch of clothes. And it was pretty well done. Production quality, information, etc, all good. When that was over I had 29 days left in the sub I had just paid for, so I decided to poke around the site a little. Saw they had a lot of what looked to be fairly in-depth programming related courses. Most were several hours of videos long. I still find it incredibly hilarious that my <a href="http://www.uat.edu/" target="_blank">alma mater</a> has online programs that cost 10's of thousands of dollars a year for what amounts to nothing beyond some power-point presentations, while all these services can have hours of actual video lectures for a fraction of that price/even free. In this case, since I am currently really focused on learning rails, I was impressed to see that they had a <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-tutorials/essential-training/47905-2.html" target="_blank">7 hour course on Ruby alone</a>, and then another <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Ruby-Rails-tutorials/Ruby-Rails-4-Essential-Training/139989-2.html" target="_blank">12 hour course on Rails</a>. I think the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/webapplications" target="_blank">Coursera Rails course</a> I am currently taking maybe has 4 hours of video content total?</p>
<p>But before diving into either of those, I thought it would be interesting to check out their entry-level '<a href="http://www.lynda.com/ViewCertificate/C0A7DD5CC5774BAC9657E28623323B38" target="_blank">Foundations of Programming: Fundamentals</a>' course. I expected it to be really boring and redundant, a bunch of stuff I already knew, but something about it made me think I should at least check it out. And it is great. Yes it's all stuff I already knew. But that doesn't change the fact that it is really good information, the production value is great, <a href="https://twitter.com/allardice" target="_blank">the instructor</a> is really charismatic. The <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/posaconcurrency" target="_blank">Coursera Android course</a> I am also taking has a bunch of video lectures. Probably a good 8-10 hours worth total. And they are both full of really good information, and really painful to watch. Just something about the delivery of them, I can barely force myself to sit through them. It certainly doesn't help that the audio is slightly out of sync with the video either, like watching a badly dubbed movie.</p>
<p>Anyways, back to the Lynda course. It's great. It uses JavaScript to illustrate the concepts, but it's not a JavaScript class. It really is exactly what it says, Programming Fundamentals. There's an entire section about compiled vs interpreted languages. When he starts talking about variables, he takes the time to explain how JavaScript is weakly typed and contrasts that to how other languages are strongly typed. When he talks about arrays he makes sure to mention how some languages use mutable arrays while others use immutable. He touches on things like object orientated concepts, memory management and even algorithms. All conceptual things that any beginning programmer needs to know, that a lot of 'syntax tutorials' ignore. And the entire ending module of the class is a series of lectures that give an overview of basically every popular language out there right now. I've said before that the <a href="http://taylorhuston.me/?p=167" target="_blank">best way to learn a language is to read a book</a>. The reason for that is because I've always found that most online classes are very tutorial-ish. More about telling you what to do in what order, not why you are doing them. Books are usually much better at going into the why. But that doesn't seem to be the case with Lynda courses, at least not the early or foundational ones. These are less like some online tutorial, and more like a legitimate college level lecture. They are less like something you might watch on <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank">Codeschool</a>, and more like something you would get from <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT Open Courseware</a>, only at a higher production value and a bit more condensed (and no textbook required). There are several courses in this 'Foundations of Programming' series, and I am getting the vibe that someone could take the time to watch them every night and, in a matter of a week or so, get the equivalent of the first year or so of a decent CS education. As someone who's dablled in and tried out a lot of different self study learn to program things, I can 100% say this is the best 'Intro To Programming' course I've come across, period.</p>
