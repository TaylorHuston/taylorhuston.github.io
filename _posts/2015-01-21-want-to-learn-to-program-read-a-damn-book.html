<p>I've basically been teaching myself computer science. Yes I have been auditing classes from my <a href="http://www.uat.edu/" target="_blank">Alma Mater</a>, but even that's been mainly self teaching. Since it's through their online program and there are no video lectures or anything, most of the classes consist entirely of an assigned textbook, assigned reading from that textbook, assigned homework (usually from that textbook), a forum for the students to post in, and a weekly 'lecture' that is almost always nothing more than a powerpoint of what are basically cliff notes from the assigned reading. Now I am not sure why a university that costs tens of thousands of dollars a year and has 'Advancing Technology' in it's name can't manage to put up YouTube videos of their lectures for the online students, but that's a complaint for another post.</p>
<p>Back to the point, I've basically been teaching myself. UAT has done a decent job of telling me what I needed to learn and in what order, but I'm still teaching myself. During this I've read textbooks, done the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/pyCoder84523" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a> thing and paid subscription tutorials like <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com/taylorhuston" target="_blank">TreeHouse</a>. You want to know which of those, by far, I have learned the most from? I'll give you three guesses.</p>
<p>CodeCademy is great for someone to dip their toe in to learn IF they want to learn more about programming. Tutorials like TreeHouse are great for practice and for reinforcing concepts. But if you really want to learn about something then read a good meaty book on it. The problem with most tutorials, ranging from posts on a blog to something with a little more production value like TreeHouse, is while they may tell you all the steps you need to do a thing, they are usually pretty poor at explaining why you are doing those steps. When you're done doing a tutorial that teaches you how to do a thing you may know how to do that thing, but if that's the only exposure you've had to that subject then chances are you can't take what you learned in the tutorial on it's own and do anything else with it.</p>
<p>You want to be a Ruby developer? Great. But don't go just do all of the <a href="https://rubymonk.com/" target="_blank">Ruby Monk</a> or <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank">Codeschool </a>Ruby courses and think that's all you need. Go pick yourself up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Program-Second-Edition-Facets-Series/dp/1934356360" target="_blank">Learn To Program</a> and marathon through it in a few days (It's only 190 pages yet still manages to touch on all of the concepts you need to know to get started) and if you like what you read then move on to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Ruby-1-9-2-0-Programmers/dp/1937785491/ref=pd_sim_b_4?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0MY0QRRBSPX4JG0A1RDT" target="_blank">Programming Ruby</a>. Then after you've done that, by all means go do all of the online video tutorials. I promise you'll get a lot more from them if in the back your mind you know WHY the instructor is telling you to do those things, as opposed to just following along on autopilot.</p>
<p>Online tutorials are great for reinforcing things you've already learned, maybe inspiring you to do something in a way you hadn't done before, generally helping your brain 'connect the dots'. But at the end of the day, for all of our advanced technology, the single best way to learn a thing is to read a good solid book on that thing.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/" target="_blank">Safari Books Online</a> subscription and it's the best investment I have ever made. That being said I am grandfathered in to a $9/mo 5 books at a time plan. When I signed up (if I remember correctly) they had a 5 book, a 10 book, and an unlimited plan. Now on their site they only seem to mention the unlimited plan for $40/mo, which at that price it might just be more economical to rent the books, or buy them used on Amazon and then re-sell them when you're done. They might also still have the lower tier plans, but maybe it's one of this things you have to sign up for the free trial, then try and cancel when that's over and they throw it out there to convince you to still subscribe (like when you try and cancel Sirius XM and they respond by giving you 6 months for like, $1). If anyone tries that and it works, be sure to leave it in a comment.</p>
