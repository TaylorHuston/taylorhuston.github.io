      <h4><a href="http://willcodeforfood.io/" target="_blank">Will Code For Food</a></h4>

      <p><a href="http://willcodeforfood.io/" target="_blank">WillCodeForFood.io</a> - A job/internship board
        specifically
        for entry-level developers (since I noticed that most 'junior' positions listed on job websites still want 5
        years
        experience in 3 different stacks, some of which aren't 5 years old). It's still in beta, I am not exctly
        actively
        promoting or monetizing it. It's built in Rails, lately I have been more focused on the MEAN stack, so it's
        currently on somewhat on hold.</p>

      <h4>Responsive Templates</h4>

      <p>I created new, fully mobile responsive versions of all the templates for <a href="http://www.therapysites.com/"
          target="_blank">TherapySites.com</a>. Previously none of the templates had any responsiveness. Additionally I
        have
        created the structure that all of the new templates will be based off of going forward to ensure that they are
        also
        responsive.</p>
