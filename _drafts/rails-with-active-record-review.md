This is a review of the first course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Web Development Specialization</a>, titled 'Rails with Active Record and Action Pack'.

Second course in the specialization, focusing mainly on Active Record and interacting with the database.

Week 1: Kind of just an overview of how Rails interacts with a database. Also introduces scaffolding but (IMHO) doesn't really do a good job of explaining WHY you would use scaffolding vs just generating the models, controllers, etc by hand. I had to do my own research on the Rails documentation as to what scaffolding actually did vs the other generators. Introduced migrations, SQLite, and some basic SQL commands and concepts. Basic CRUD operations via Rails. It also BRIEFLY covers some advanced-ish Ruby concepts, like dynamic and ghost methods (which are the terms used in the video, not sure if they are correct). While these aren't super complicated concepts, if you're coming from a C-Style background, this brief overview of them probably isn't enough, and most people will have to do some more reading up on them outside of what's covered in the lecture videos.
