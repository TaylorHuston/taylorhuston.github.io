I am going to start reviewing all of the Coursera courses I am taking. This is a review of the first course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack" target="_blank">Full Stack Web Development Specialization</a>, titled 'HTML, CSS and JavaScript'. 

Quick review is that the course isn't very good. 

For one thing it's $79, despite being half the length of most Coursera courses (three weeks as opposed to six). Which means you're over $25/week. From a pure ROI point of view, you could get a lot more information by signing up for Lynda or Code School or Treehouse for a month or so.

Content wise, it's not very good either. It's a very introductory course, so for me it was more than a bit boring to sit through, but I can't even recommend it for a complete noob as some of the information, in my opinion, is bad. For example, early on the instructor brings up various style tags. He does things like mention both <pre><em> and <i></pre> in the same lecture and merely states that they will both display the same way in the browser. He doesn't go into the semantic differences between them at all, which could lead someone who didn't know any better to assume they were identical and interchangeable. He also references w3Schools as a 'good resource' to learn from, which is just plain wrong.

So this course isn't good, but chances are you're not taking it standalone, you're taking it to as part of the specialization. Time will tell if the rest of the classes are good enough to justify the total price ($474 in total) or not. But if you're just looking for a standalone course to teach you the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, look elsewhere. There are much better options.
