I am going to start reviewing all of the Coursera courses I am taking. This is a review of the first course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails Web Development Specialization</a>, titled 'Ruby on Rails: An Introduction'. 

I am pretty impressed with this class. I was worried at first, the first week is literally just 'how to set up Ruby' videos for all the major OS's. Not a single line of code. Considering it's a three week course, I was a little worried I wouldn't be getting much for my money.

The second week picked up though. Was a good overview of all of the Ruby you will need to get started using Rails. Did a pretty good job of covering all the bases. Now it obviously couldn't go TOO into depth into a lot of things, and doesn't try to. It definitely assumes you already have some objected orientated programming experience, that you know (conceptually) what classes and inheritance and all that jazz is. So if you're already a semi decent programmer than this course seems to be a good introduction to the RoR world. I don't think this class aloe is worth the $79 price tag, merely due to it's relatively short length, but if the rest of the specialization is as high of quality than overall it whould be worth the price.
