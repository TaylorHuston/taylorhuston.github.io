This is a review of the first course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack" target="_blank">Full Stack Web Development Specialization</a>, titled 'Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools'.

This course builds off the previous one in the specialization, serving as a rough overview of Full JavaScript Stack, from the Front-End point of view.

Week 1 is an overview of the course, an introduction to the term 'Full Stack Web Development' from a very JavaScript centric perspective (no mention of Rails, no details about PHP, Java, etc). It also includes an overview of Front-End Frameworks, with a focus on bootstrap. I'm not really a fan of frameworks, I believe that they basically invalidate the whole point of using CSS to keep presentational information out of the HTML, but who knows, maybe as I get more experience with them that opinion will change.

At 4 weeks (a whole week longer than the last course), it, like the class that came before it, isn't really a good value for the money. This one has a different instructor, and he definitely seems more knowledgable than the last, and all of the information in the course is fine, but it's continuing the trend (which I am thinking will really apply to the entire specialization) that you can get more bang for your buck by subscribing to any one of the numerous other web-based tutorials, or just buying a book.
