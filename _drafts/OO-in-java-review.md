I am going to start reviewing all of the Coursera courses I am taking. This is a review of the first course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/full-stack" target="_blank">Java Programming: Object-Oriented Design of Data Structures Specialization</a>, titled 'Object Oriented Programming in Java'. 

Initially I was thinking about dropping this course altogether. I already know a lot of Java, so I just assumed that I wouldn't get much out of it and in the end it wouldn't be much more than a waste of time and money. I'm glad I stuck with it because the course is great.

Unike the first courses in the other two specializations I am taking right now, this course was six weeks, making that $79 fee much more reasonable. Not only is it twice the length, but each week is filled with a lot more content. There are several video tracks. The main track which contains the 'required' information for the week, but then additional, optional videos that are there for people who may not quite get it and need a little more information. Basically they are trying really hard to accomodate people with varying levels of programming backgrounds. This also includes a bunch of video interviews with Google SEs, which I found very useful.

The only negative I found with the course is that you don't actually turn in any code. There are weekly assignments, but you basically do them and then once they work (by comparing them to the example) you just do a quiz that asks questions based on the actual assignment. Not as nice as having some actual feedback on your code, but I guess it's understandable given the nature of being a course with hundreds of students. Can't exactly have a TA go through each submission by hand.
