<p>This is my ever expanding list of actors who I believe are truly talented, but make horrible movies.  And I don't mean the occasional bad flick, I mean consistently make horrible movie over and over and over again.</p>
<p><strong>Will Ferell</strong><br />
Fantastic actor, from great comedy like his run on SNL and films such as Anchorman to more serious roles like Everything Must Go and Stranger Then Fiction (one of my favorite films).  Makes horrible films, like Kicking and Screaming, Semi-Pro, Blades of Glory, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Robert De Niro</strong><br />
De Niro used to be one of the most respected actors in Hollywood with a film career that spanned decades and included some incredibly iconic roles.  But, especially in the last 10 years or so, for there seems to be more and more roles he just took for the money.  There has been a few gems, like Stardust which, even if you don't like that movie you have to admit he did a great job, his career has either been bad sequels (Meet the Fockers, Analyze That) or bad dramas where he just seemed to phone in his lines.  Showtime, Righteous Kill, 15 Minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Nicolas Cage</strong><br />
Nicolas Cage is a great actor.  Even in a bad role in a bad film, you can see that he has talent to spare.  But it just seems like he will take any script shoved in front of him.  He's like the popular guy in High School that could have his pick of women, but that doesn't stop him from getting drunk and sleeping with  anything that moves on a weekly basis.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Murphy<br />
</strong>Probably the biggest offender of this crime.  Great actor, as seen by everything before the first Nutty Professor.  Makes HORRIBLE films, as seen by everything after the first Nutty Professor.  Just absolutely dog shit films. I mean, come on, Norbit?  My only theory can be is that sometime during the filming of Nutty Professor he was replaced by an alien pod version of himself.</p>
