<p>Like I stated in my blog, while I am technically auditing my way through my Alma Mater's CS degree, I am basically teaching myself. While UAT may not have been the best at teaching me what I needed to know, it at least told me what things and in what order I needed to teach myself. Which, really, with the way the internet is, everything you need to know about CS can be found completely free online. So in that spirit I've decided to outline a general curriculum of (mostly) free resources (not counting textbooks you may want to get) that anyone can use to teach themselves CS.</p>
<p>Resources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Webcasts</a> - I wish I had found out about this sooner. They are putting full, up to date videos of a lot of their classes online for free. And in many cases the classes have accompanying websites that have all of the homework, midterms and finals, all with solutions. You can even start watching them the first day of a new semester and follow right along with the students like you were in class.</li>
<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-department/" target="_blank">MIT OCW</a> - MIT has a lot of archived courses online. The information is good (it is from MIT) but the quality of the courses is hit or miss. And by that I mean some have full video lectures and everything, while others may just be slides. Also the course numbering is a little inconsistent as well, so it can be a little confusing as to which course to do "next". I've only mentioned courses that include video lectures. Most have assignments and exams with solutions.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a> - Coursera has a lot of Computer Science related classes, and are adding more and more all the time. They aren't self paced, so you have to be vigilant about watching for when classes start and sign up in time, but most of the important classes (the ones I mention here) seem to re-run at regular intervals so that shouldn't be too much of an issue. Some of the classes offer the ability to pay a small fee and get a verified certificate of completion, if that matters to you.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.edx.org/course" target="_blank">edX</a> - EDx has a few CS related classes. It doesn't seem to have as many as Coursera and they don't re-run as often (this of course may change) but there still seems to be some good classes in there that you might want to take if you have the time. They are also introducing their 'xSeries' sequences which, similar to some Coursera Specializations, you can pay a small fee and get a verified certificate of completion. As of writing this they seem to be piloting a 'Foundations of Computer Science' certificate (I say piloting since only the first two classes have been released, with the latter scheduled over the course of the next year).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> - While they've actually recently introduced some CS related courses, they don't seem to be very in-depth, more of a light introduction. That may change in the future. But regardless when it comes to math it's a GREAT resource.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/" target="_blank">Safari Books Online</a> - If you're more of a reader, for a relatively low monthly fee you can subscribe to this service and just <a title="Want to learn to program? Read a book!" href="http://taylorhuston.me/?p=167" target="_blank">read a good book</a> on all of the subjects you need to know.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic Syntax:<br />
To get started you need to understand the basic concepts of writing code. Most of these classes will all cover the bases you need to know. By the time you are done the general idea is to understand the following concepts in at least one programming language: Variables, Basic Input and Output, Loops and Conditionals, Classes, Inheritance and Object-Orientated Programming Concepts, and basic Data Structures (at least Arrays and Linked Lists).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Webcasts</a> - CS61A, 61B, 61C. Berkeley's year long 3 course introduction to CS. From the official course introduction "The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view. This first course concentrates mostly on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware. The next course, CS 61B, will deal with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs. Finally, CS 61C concentrates on machines and how they carry out the programs you write." Looks like it starts with Python and goes through Data Structures in Java, so thoroughly covers EVERYTHING you need to know to get started. I haven't taken them yet, but being that it's from Berkeley I am assuming it's high quality stuff. Look for the latest offerings on <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkeley Webcasts</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.edx.org/xseries">Foundations of Computer Science xSeries from MITx</a> - Since this is based off of MIT classes, it's also probably a good place to start. Like I said it seems to be in a pilot phase. As of writing this enrollment for the first class is closed, and I have no idea when it will start up again, but it may be worth keeping an eye on. Also, unlike the other suggestions in this section, this one has the ability to pay for verified certificates of completion, if that's important to you.</li>
<li><a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">Harvard CS50</a> - This is a very well regarded introductory CS class. Since it's only one course I don't know how in depth it goes, but it's probably a good place to get your feet wet. You can take it self paced anytime through <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x#.VPZM4EagS-4">edX</a> or the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">class website</a>.</li>
<li>MIT OCW. <a>6.00</a> and <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/">6.01</a> also look to be a good introduction to CS using Python.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321498054/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=introcs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321498054" target="_blank">Programming in Java</a> - This book, along with it's associated <a href="http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/home/" target="_blank">booksite</a>, is a great and thorough introduction to programming and CS concepts. It also has several followup books that I will mention later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculus:<br />
Technically you don't NEED to know Calculus to be a developer. You can probably get away with just High School Algebra. But if you want to be a good developer, the more math you know the better.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus">Khan Academy</a> has a great sequence of all the things in Calculus. It also has plenty of Precalculus and Trig information if you need a refresher.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1">Coursera</a> has a self-paced Calculus course you can take anytime, which mainly pulls from <a href="https://mooculus.osu.edu/">Ohio State Calculus One</a>. They also periodically have a more advanced <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/calcsing">Single Variable Calculus</a> course you can take that has the option of paying for a verified certificate. Looks to be intended more for people who have already been exposed to Calculus at the High School level.</li>
<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/">MIT OCW</a> has full classes on Single-Variable and Multi-Variable Calculus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Discrete Math:<br />
Discrete math is a tricky subject. It's definitely important to a CS student, though more so than any other class it seems to vary. From the few curriculums I have seen, every college is different. Sometimes it's a stand-alone class (or two) you take your first year, other times it's just rolled into an Algorithms class you take as a Junior. But regardless, while you don't have to be an expert (most of the courses on the subject seem to have very generous grading policies), having a good understanding of the concepts will help you a great deal down the road.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkely Webcasts</a> - CS70. Berkely's Discrete Math and Probability course. The natural successor to the 61x sequence from above. It's what I used to learn it (UAT does not have a Discrete Math class as part of their curriculum) and I can attest that it is really well done.</li>
<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/" target="_blank">MIT OCW</a> - Mathematics for Computer Science. I haven't taken this class, but at first glance it seems very thorough.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus">Khan Academy</a> - While they don't have a Discrete Math class specifically, you can cherry pick videos from other classes to reinforce some of the Discrete Math concepts. Specifically their <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/prob_comb" target="_blank">probability</a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus/sequences_series_approx_calc/calculus-series/v/sigma-notation-sum" target="_blank">sequences </a>playlists are good review.</li>
</ul>
<p>Algorithms:<br />
Your bread and butter. The most important thing you need to master to be a good developer.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Berkely Webcasts</a> - CS170. Berkeley's Algorithms class. I haven't taken it yet, but I probably will at some point.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI" target="_blank">Coursera Princeton </a>- Runs very frequently and serves as a great introductory course. Very implementation based. Goes over all of the needed Data Structures as well. Doesn't require a lot of math or complicated analysis. It's also taught by the same instructor as the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321498054/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=introcs-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321498054" target="_blank">Programming in Java</a>. It's the natural followup to that book (though really anyone with any background in Java can take the course). It also has a great <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-4th-Edition-Robert-Sedgewick/dp/032157351X" target="_blank">textbook </a>and an associated <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/" target="_blank">booksite</a>. Pretty much all of the resources you need to really to get a good grasp of the concept. I found it to be much more instructive than UAT's Algorithms class. Additionally it has two <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/aofa" target="_blank">followup </a><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ac" target="_blank">classes</a>, that also have associated textbooks from the same author, if you're so inclined (though they are more math heavy, should be taken after you've learned Calculus and Discrete Math). Also (Unlike the first book in this 'series' for some reason) these three textbooks are all available through <a href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/" target="_blank">Safari Books Online</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algo" target="_blank">Coursera Stanford</a> - Stanford also sponsors an Algorithms class on Coursera. This one is language agnostic and definitely more theory/math based. An interesting class, but one you should wait to take until after Calculus and Discrete Math. It uses the classic textbook <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms" target="_blank">CLRS</a>. A thorough, if a bit intimidating, textbook that every Computer Scientist should read through at some point in there careers.</li>
<li><a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/" target="_blank">MIT OCW</a> - Their introductory Algorithms class. Uses Python and is a good followup to the other MIT OCW courses I've mentioned so far.</li>
