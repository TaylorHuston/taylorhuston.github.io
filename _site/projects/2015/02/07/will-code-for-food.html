  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I've decided to make a job board, <a href="http://willcodeforfood.io/" target="_blank">Will Code For Food</a>.</p>
<p>The premise is this (copied from the 'about' page on that site):</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Tired of seeing ‘junior’ positions that want 3-5 years of experience in 9 different stacks, some of which aren’t even 5 years old? Sick of wading through hundreds of job postings looking for one that you, as a new developer, are qualified for? Well so was I, so I decided to create this site.</p>
<p>This job board is only for jobs, internships and apprenticeships for people still in college, new graduated, recently self taught, and anyone else who wants a developer job but has no work experience. It’s free to search, and for the time being free to post. I fit strongly into the category of someone who would use this site. Currently looking to get my first real developer job. After spending another evening looking through job boards and not finding much that someone with no actual work experience should realistically apply for, I got frustrated and decided to throw this site up. I grabbed the domain name and got to work.</p>
<p>Phase 1 – Right now this site is built using WordPress and <a href="http://www.wpjobmanager.com/" target="_blank">WP Job Manager</a>. Functionality is fairly limited. You can browse jobs and apply to them by following the link. It’s not what I envision, but I wanted to get something up ASAP.</p>
<p>Phase 2 – The next phase will be a complete job board built from scratch. Partly because I think this will be fun to build, and partly because I really want to customize it for developers. Features I have in mind for phase 2 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete job-seeker profiles.</li>
<li>The ability to sign up with and integrate your GitHub profile.</li>
<li>The ability to apply to jobs directly.</li>
<li>The ability to display some of your accomplishments, such as your HackerRank or Project Euler scores.</li>
<li>The ability to display your progress in things like The Odin Project or Code School.</li>
<li>A blog with submission from hiring managers and industry professionals full of advice on getting that first job.</li>
<li>Anything else I come up with.</li>
</ul>
<p>===</p>
<p>Like I mentioned in that blurb, right now it's just Wordpress. Not that there's anything wrong with Wordpress, it's what I use for this blog and despite some 'pro' developers looking down on it, I still happen to think it's a solid CMS. That being said I do plan on eventually building a custom solution for it. Not that I think it will be <em>better</em> than Wordpress, but because I think it would be a really god learning exercise and a great addition to my portfolio. I have no idea how successfull it will be, not because I don't think it's a good idea, but I really have no idea how to market or properly monetize it against the insane amount of job boards already out there. But who knows, it could take off and running it could be my full time job one day.</p>
<p>Take a look and drop me a line if you like what you see, and on the off chance you're hiring go ahead and post a job!</p>
