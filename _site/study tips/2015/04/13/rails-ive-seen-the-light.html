    <p>I know it's been a while since I've posted. Honestly, noting particularly noteworthy has happened. But I thought it'd be good to touch base.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>30 Days:</strong></span> I've reached a personal milestone. 30 straight days of contributions to <a href="https://github.com/TaylorHuston" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. While I've been coding almost every day for a while now, due to a lot of it being homework assignments and other things I can't make publicly available this is the first time I've been able to actually push something to GitHub for a month straight. And it's really kept me motivated. Since I don't want to break the streak I am less likely to say "man I coded all day yesterday, I'm just going to take the day off".</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rails:</strong></span> Welp I've seen the light. While I still think that JS syntax is <a title="Focusing on JavaScript" href="http://taylorhuston.me/?p=235" target="_blank">more intuitive</a> to me, I can see why people love Rails. It is insanely easy to get a minimum viable product up and running quickly. And I can really see how the whole convention over configuration thing is great. You can look at any Rails app written by anyone and start with a pretty good idea of where everything is. I'm about halfway done with the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/webapplications" target="_blank">Coursera Rails</a> course, and almost done with <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/" target="_blank">Michael Hartl's Book.</a> After that I plan on reading through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-Edition-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Series/dp/0321944275" target="_blank">The Rails 4 Way.</a> I think at that point I will be to the point where I can start looking into entry level Rails jobs, or maybe a Bootcamp? Right now I am just creating the sample app outlined in Hartl's book directly, but after I am done with that my next project will be re-doing <a href="http://willcodeforfood.io/" target="_blank">Will Code For Food</a> in Rails. Should be an excellent learning opportunity.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Android:</strong></span> I'm also still in the middle of the second <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/posaconcurrency" target="_blank">Coursera Android</a> course. I will admit though that I've been so focused on Rails that I haven't been giving that class the attention it deserves. I am going to need to spend this week focusing on getting caught up on it. I also got a copy of <a href="https://commonsware.com/Android/" target="_blank">The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development</a>. Haven't had a chance to really look at it, but it sounds like a great resource. For one thing, it's huge. At over 3000 pages it dwarfs any other programming book I've come across. I also like that it's regularly updated. For something as ever-evolving as Android that's really important to me. I looked at some other Android books (I still stand by the assertion that the best way to learn something is to <a title="Want to learn to program? Read a book!" href="http://taylorhuston.me/?p=167" target="_blank">read a good book</a>), and they were all already out of date. Couldn't find one that was highly rated and covered Android 5.0+. While I don't think a book that only went up to say, Android 4.4 wouldn't be full of useful information, I don't want to feel like I am being left behind in any way. Technology moves so fast that I think regularly updated online textbooks are the future.</p>
