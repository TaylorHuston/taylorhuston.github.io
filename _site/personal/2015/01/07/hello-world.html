  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Hello World, and welcome to my blog.</p>
<p>I guess this is where I should tell you a little about me and why I am making this site. The tl;dr version is simple:<br />
I want to be a professional software developer, and I am hoping this site helps with that.</p>
<p>The longer version is a little more complicated. Guess I should start at the beginning? I was always a pretty smart kid. I was placed in the program for gifted kids way back in Elementary school. In High School I was mostly Honors and Advanced Placement (including AP Computer Science) classes. But what I had in brains usually wasn't enough to compensate for my complete lack of focus. I was diagnosed with ADHD pretty young, but never treated for it. My mother didn't want to "drug up" her son, and to be honest I wasn't too keen on the idea of taking pills every day either. So I ended up spending most of High School skipping class, chasing girls and only showing up on test day. I never had any clear direction or focus and my poor single mother spent all of her time and energy keeping a roof over our heads. There wasn't much left over to discipline me and keep me in line.</p>
<p>After I graduated High School that didn't really change. Still smart, still lacking any semblance of direction or focus. I always had a lot of people telling me that I could "do anything I put my mind to", no one actually telling me what that should be. I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I ended up enrolling in <a href="http://www.uat.edu" target="_blank">The University of Advancing Computer Technology's</a> B.A. in Game Design program because, well why not. I liked video games and making them for a living sounded like it would be a blast. Plus, while I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, I knew that staying in Alaska wasn't part of it, so doing the smart thing and just going to the University of Alaska, getting a B.S. in CS on that sweet low in-state tuition was out of the question. In retrospect, not my brightest decision.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years and I graduated with a decent amount of debt and not a lot in the way of job skills. Sure the degree was fun. A lot of the classes were interesting, but they weren't all that practical. One Intro to Programming class that covered less than the AP Computer Science class I took in High School, a few basic 3D Animation classes, and then just a lot of design and theory. Not enough to get an entry level programming or animation job, at a game studio or elsewhere. During college I paid the bills with IT related work; started at Geeksquad, moved on to help-desk here, network admin there, etc. After college I was able to use that experience, as well as my 'design' background, to land the gig I have now.</p>
<p>I currently work for <a href="http://www.therapysites.com" target="_blank">TherapySites</a> in a customer support/helpdesk/some basic front end design role. Basically we have a custom in-house CMS, customers call or email in when they have problems, and I either walk them through it or do it for them. Sometimes it's a request that our CMS can't actually do, so I get to dig in and code it manually, but that's relatively rare. It's not a bad job all things considered. It's paid the bills so far, it's a remote job so the commute is fantastic, and I like the people I work with. Met my best friend through it. But I've definitely reached my ceiling with them. That combined with a few health scares in my immediate family last year made it apparent that neither I, nor the people I care about, are getting any younger. I spent all of my youth telling my mom that I was going to be rich when I grew up and I was going to buy her a "big house with a swimming pool." Recent events have made it clear that I need to get on that.</p>
<p>Luckily being an alumni of UAT means I can audit any of their classes for free. I have been auditing my way through their CS degree program (online) and I feel like I am to the point where I have the fundamentals down. I have a fairly solid grasp of both Java and C++, along with the 'core' CS fundamentals like data structures, algorithms and software design principles. In addition to that I've supplemented it with a lot of self study through things like Coursera, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/pyCoder84523" target="_blank">CodeCademy</a> and <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/taylorhuston" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>. I'm not 'done' (not that I think one can ever truly be done learning) yet, but really close.</p>
<p>Right now I am focusing on creating this portfolio, getting some things up on GitHub (most of the things I have done so far have either been homework for a class I was auditing or a class from Coursera, not things I would want to put online for anyone to cheat from, and working full time in addition to auditing classes hasn't left a lot of free time for personal projects), and really solidifying my understanding of Algorithms. UAT's online program consist of one 5-week class at a time. I feel as if their one 5-week Algorithms class only scratched the surface. I'm finishing up my way through <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/" target="_blank">Algorithms, 4th Ed</a> and it's associated <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI" target="_blank">Coursera Princeton courses</a>, and will probably take the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algo" target="_blank">Coursera Stanford Algorithms</a> class as well next time it is offered. I'm also currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/mobilecloudcomputing2/36?" target="_blank">Coursera's Android Specialization</a>.</p>
<p>So I decided to start this blog as a way to track my progress, talk about what I've learned, and keep me focused. When I have to write regular blog posts about the progress I have made, I will be much more motivated to ensure I have something to talk about in said posts.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
