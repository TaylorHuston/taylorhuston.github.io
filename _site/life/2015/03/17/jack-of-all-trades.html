  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I get distracted easily. Or maybe a nicer way of putting it is I have a lot of interests.</p>
<p>Lately, especially the last year, I've really been focused on writing code. Auditing/self teaching my way through a CS degree. And I love it. I love writing code. But it's not what I've always wanted to do, and not necessarily what I always want to do. When I was in college I did IT stuff. Geek Squad, Helpdesk for one ISP, IT contractor for another ISP, worked for a Managed Service Provider basically doing all the onsite work for a while. I took a Cisco class in High School, and I still technically have my A+ and Network+ certs. Sometimes I seriously think about going back and getting my CCNA and going down that route.</p>
<p>I've thought about getting some Linux certs as well. One would think that, if I am developing web apps that live on a Linux server somewhere, being able to admin that server would only be helpful.</p>
<p>Or, another great example, something that I find really interesting and would love to sink my teeth into is InfoSec. Maybe it's a little cliche, but the thought of being a 'hacker' has a certain....sexy appeal to it. Plus if it lands me a girl as pretty as young Angelina Jolee then it would be totally worth it (10 points if you get the reference). Sometimes I think about grabbing my Security+, then studying for and getting my Certified Ethical Hacker and seeing where that leads me. Not necessarily to help my career directly, but just because I find those topics interesting personally and I love to learn. I'm not thinking that getting my CCNA would in any way directly help me land a a web developer job.</p>
<p>But would it be worth it? Do employers like seeing someone who has a lot if interests, or do they not care if it isn't directly related to the job they are hiring you for? Is a lot of different skills and certifications on a resume going to make an interviewer think you're intelligent, ambitious and a quick learner, or that you're a jack of all trades, master of none? If it's a job as say, a Java developer, are they going to be impressed about anything you've done that isn't directly related to writing code, or do they just want someone who does nothing but eat, sleep and write Java all day?</p>
<p>And of course there's the opportunity cost. Even if an interviewer won't knock points off your application because you have your CCNA (especially if you don't mention it to them), at the end of the day the 100 hours you put into studying for it is 100 hours you could have put into writing all the code.</p>
<p>If I was hiring, I'd like to think I'd be impressed by someone who has a variety of technical related interests. To me it would show curiosity and an ability to learn new things. I see someone who is really good at one thing and only focuses at one thing as someone who doesn't handle change very well. But that's just me, I've never been in the position of having to interview or hire someone, so I really have no point of reference to base that on.</p>
<p>What about you guys? Any developers out there who also happen to have their CCNA or something and had it help or hurt them in an interview? Anyone start off writing code, then get an interest in InfoSec, got some certs, and make the jump?</p>
